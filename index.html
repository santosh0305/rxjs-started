What is an Observable?
An observable represents a stream, or source of data that can arrive over time. observables are cold.
</p>
<p>
  Subscriptions are what set everything in motion. You can think of this like a faucet, you have a stream of water ready to be tapped (observable), someone just needs to turn the handle. In the case of observables, that role belongs to the subscriber.</p>
<pre>

import { fromEvent } from 'rxjs';

// grab button reference
const button = document.getElementById('myButton');

// create an observable of button clicks
const myObservable = fromEvent(button, 'click');

// for now, let's just log the event on each click
const subscription = myObservable.subscribe(event => console.log(event));
</pre>
<p>
  Set up an event listener on our button for click events.
Call the function we passed to the subscribe method (observer) on each click event.
Return a subscription object with an unsubscribe which contains clean up logic, like removing appropriate event listeners</p>

<pre>
  // instead of a function, we will pass an object with next, error, and complete methods
const subscription = myObservable.subscribe({
  // on successful emissions
  next: event => console.log(event),
  // on errors
  error: error => console.log(error),
  // called once on completion
  complete: () => console.log('complete!')
});

// clean up with unsubscribe
subscription.unsubscribe();
secondSubscription.unsubscribe();
</pre> -->
